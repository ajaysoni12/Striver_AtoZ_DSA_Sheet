## Striver's DSA Sheet Solutions in C++
This repository contains my solutions
to Striver's SDE sheet problems using C++ programming. The Striver's SDE sheet is a popular resource for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) 

The solutions provided here are written in C++ and cover various topics including arrays, strings, linked lists, binary trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more.
Each problem is solved using an efficient approach and is accompanied by comments explaining the logic behind the solution.

## Structure
- Array
- String
- LinkedList
- BinaryTree
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph
- etc


## Running the Code
You will need a C++ compiler installed on your system to run the code. You can use popular compilers like GCC or Clang.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the specific folder containing the problem you want to run.

Compile the C++ file using the appropriate compiler command. For example, using GCC:
g++ filename.cpp -o output
Run the compiled executable:  
./output  


Striver's DSA Sheet Solutions in C++
This repository contains my solutions to the Striver's SDE sheet problems using the C++ programming language. The Striver's SDE sheet is a popular resource for practicing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and is curated by SDE at Amazon and ex-Microsoft - Aditya Verma, also known as "Striver".

The solutions provided here are written in C++ and cover various topics including arrays, strings, linked lists, binary trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. Each problem is solved using an efficient approach and is accompanied by comments explaining the logic behind the solution.

Structure
The repository is organized into different folders, each corresponding to a specific topic or section of the Striver's SDE sheet. The folder structure is as follows:

markdown
Copy code
- Array
  - Array1
  - Array2
  ...
- String
  - String1
  - String2
  ...
- LinkedList
  - LinkedList1
  - LinkedList2
  ...
- BinaryTree
  - BinaryTree1
  - BinaryTree2
  ...
- Dynamic Programming
  - DP1
  - DP2
  ...
- Graph
  - Graph1
  - Graph2
